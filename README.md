# Homify

This is my final project for CS50, which is a Computer Science course offered by Harvard University both on-campus and online. The name of my project is "Homify," and it is a platform that enables users to search for rental homes and homestays. Additionally, Homify provides property owners with the flexibility to list their properties for rent.

## Sections

Homify consists of two main sections:

1. Property Owners: In this section, property owners can create accounts and list their properties for rent. They can manage their listings and get detailed information about their tenants and properties through the partner dashboard.

2. Users: These are regular users who can browse and purchase rental homes. They can create accounts or sign in as guests to make purchases. Once they've made a purchase, they can view the details of the properties they've bought in their user profile.

## Usage Instructions

### For Property Owners

1. Explore the web application to familiarize yourself with its features.
2. To become a property owner, click on the "handshake" icon in the navigation bar. This will take you to the partner account creation page.
3. Create a partner account by providing the necessary information. Feel free to test the functionality by uploading sample property listings.
4. Try purchasing one of your own listed properties to see how the process works.
5. During the purchase, a popup will appear, prompting you to sign up or log in as a user. Complete the signup/login process to proceed with the purchase.
6. After completing the purchase, log back into your partner account.
7. Your recently purchased property will be displayed on your partner dashboard, which provides detailed information about your tenants and properties through charts, graphs, and tables.

### For Users

2. To create a user account, click on the "user" icon in the navigation bar. Alternatively, you can create an account during the property purchase process.
3. If you haven't signed up or logged in yet, a popup will appear during the purchase, guiding you through the signup/login process.
4. Start purchasing rental properties according to your preferences.
5. To view the details of the properties you've purchased, click on your name with the user icon in the navigation bar, then select "profile" from the dropdown menu.
