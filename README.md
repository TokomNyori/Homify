This is my cs50's final project. cs50 is a Computer Science course (on-campus and online) offered by Harvard University. cs50 is quite popular among CS courses. My project name is "Homify" where you can search for rental homes and homestays. Homify also gives flexibility to property owners to list their properties for rent.
There are different README.md files in different sections that explains its functionality.

There are two sections in this web application:

1. Property Owners-- Property owners can list their properties for rent.
2. Users-- These are the normal users who are going to search and purchase rental homes.

I've already created many partner accounts, one of them is a partner account for Sir David:  
user id- davidmalan@gmail.com  
password- poiuytre

There is a pre-existing user demo account for Sir David:  
user id- davidmalan@gmail.com  
password- dddddddd

Todos and info for the prperty owner:

1. Explore the web aplication
2. Click on the 'handshake' icon from the navbar and create a partner account and start listing properties (you can just play it around and upload anything)
3. Try purchasing your own listed properties
4. While purchasing, a popup will appear for you to signup/login as a user. Complete the signup/login process and start purschasing...
5. Go back to your partner account and sign in
6. The property you've just purchased will be reflected in your dashboard. You'll be able to see it in your dashboard(partner dashboard)
7. The dashboard is equiped with chart, graph, and tables to give you detail information about your tenants and properties.

Todos and info for the users:

1. Explore the web application
2. You can create a user account from anywhere in the web application by clicking on the 'user' icon from the navbar or you can create while purchasing the property
3. While purchasing, a popup will appear for you to signup/login as a user if you haven't signed up or signed in already.
